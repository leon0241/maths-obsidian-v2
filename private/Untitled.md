The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\left| \sin(n) \right|}{n}$ does not diverge; it converges. This is known as the Dirichlet Test.

The Dirichlet Test states that if you have a series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n b_n$, where:

1. $\left| \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \right|$ is bounded (i.e., it doesn't grow indefinitely).
2. ${b_n}$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence that converges to zero (i.e., $b_n \geq b_{n+1}$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = 0$),

Then, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n b_n$ converges.

In the case of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\left| \sin(n) \right|}{n}$:

1. The sequence ${a_n}$ is $\frac{1}{n}$, which clearly satisfies $\left| \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \right|$ being bounded since it's a convergent p-series with $p = 1$.
2. The sequence ${b_n}$ is $\left| \sin(n) \right|$, which is a bounded oscillating function that stays between 0 and 1. While it doesn't have a limit as $n$ approaches infinity, it oscillates between these values and is monotonically decreasing.

Because both conditions of the Dirichlet Test are met, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\left| \sin(n) \right|}{n}$ converges.


The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(n)}{n}$ is not absolutely convergent.

To determine absolute convergence, we need to consider the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin(n)}{n}\right|$.

The absolute value of the sine function, $\left|\sin(n)\right|$, is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, $\left|\frac{\sin(n)}{n}\right| \leq \frac{1}{n}$ for all positive integers $n$.

The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ is the harmonic series, and it is well-known that the harmonic series diverges. Since $\left|\frac{\sin(n)}{n}\right|$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{n}$ and the harmonic series diverges, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin(n)}{n}\right|$ also diverges.

Therefore, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(n)}{n}$ is not absolutely convergent. However, it does exhibit conditional convergence, meaning that it converges when considering both positive and negative terms together.
