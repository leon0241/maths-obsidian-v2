> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Pages/Definition of a curve reparameterisation|Definition of a curve reparameterisation]]
> Let $g:(k,l)\to (a,b),\,\tau\mapsto t$ be a smooth map with $g'(\tau)\ne 0$ everywhere. The [[Pages/Definition of a Curve#^7e4b5a|curve]] $\tilde{x}(\tau)=x(g(\tau))$ is a **reparameterisation** of $x(t)$. If $g'>0$ it preserves [[Pages/Definition of a Curve#^7e4b5a|orientation]] (the curve is traversing the same path in the same direction, but at a different [[Pages/Norm of a Curve#^d8cb44|speed]])
