> is nonempty (i.e. it contains at least one number). Moreover if $\lambda(I_{n})\to 0$, where $\lambda(I_{n})$ denotes the length of interval $I_{n}$, then $E$ contains exactly one number

> - The property might not hold if "closed" is omitted from the statement of the theorem. Consider $I_{n} = (0, 1/n)$
> - The property might not hold is "bounded" is omitted from the statement of the theorem. Consider $I_{n}=[n,\infty)$
