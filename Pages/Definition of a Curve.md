> A (parameterised) curve in Euclidean space is a (smooth) map $x:(a,b)\to \mathbb{E}^n$,
> $$t\mapsto x(t) = \left(\begin{array}
> x^1(t) \\
> x^2(t) \\
> \vdots \\
> x^n(t)
> \end{array}\right)$$
> An **orientation** of the curve is a prescribed direction of travel along the curve. We will always take this to be the direction in which the paramter $t$ is increasing.
