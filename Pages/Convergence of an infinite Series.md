> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Pages/Convergence of an infinite Series|Convergence of an infinite Series]]
> Let $S=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}$ be an infinite series $a_{k}$. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the partial sum of $S$ of order $n$ is defined by
> $$s_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{k}$$
> $S$ is said to *converge* iff its sequence of partial sums $(s_{n})$ converges to some $s \in\mathbb{R}$ as $n\to\infty$; that is, iff for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\ge N$ we have $\lvert s_{n}-s \rvert < \epsilon$. In this case we shall write
> $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k} = s$$
> and call $s$ the *sum* or *value* of the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}$
