> Let $S=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}$ be an absolutely convergent series. Then
> - The series $S$ is convergent
> - Let $z:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection. Then the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ is convergent and
> $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)} $$
> The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ is called a *rearrangement* of the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}$. What we do here is add the terms of the sum in a different order to the original one, for example
> $$a_{3} + a_{7}+ a_{1}+ a_{100} + a_{2} + \dots$$
> Since $z:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ is a bijection, we will miss no terms.
