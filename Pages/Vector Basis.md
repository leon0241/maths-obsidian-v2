> A basis of $V$ is a set $\{e_{i}\in V:\mathbf{i}=1,\dots,\,n\}$ with the following properties:
> - **Spans $V$:** $\forall v\in V$, $v=\sum_{i=1}^{n}v^ie_{i}$, for some $v^i\in\mathbb{R}$
> - **Linearly independent:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^ie_{i}=0\implies a^i=0,\,\forall i=1,\dots,n$
> The number of elements in a basis $n$ is called the *dimension* of $V$ and it is independent of basis
