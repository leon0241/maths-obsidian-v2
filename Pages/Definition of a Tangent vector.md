> A curve $x(t)$ is **regular** if its velocity $x'(t)\ne 0$ for all $t\in(a,b)$. The **tangent line** to a regular curve $x(t)$ at $x(t^0)$ is the line $\{x(t^0) + \lambda x'(t^0)\mid \lambda \in\mathbb{R}\}$

For each $t$, we can think of $x'(t)$ as a vector, sitting at $x(t)$, tangent to the curve $x(t)$. This is depicted in the figure below, where the arrows denote the velocities of the curve at the indeicated points.
