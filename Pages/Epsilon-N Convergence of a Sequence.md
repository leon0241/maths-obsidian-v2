> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Pages/Epsilon-N Convergence of a Sequence|Epsilon-N Convergence of a Sequence]]
> A sequence of real numbers $(x_{n})$ is said to *converge* to a real number $a\in \mathbb{R}$ iff for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
> $$n\ge N \text{ implies } \lvert x_{n} - a \rvert < \epsilon$$
> If $(x_{n})$ converges to $a$, we will write $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n}=a$, or $x_{n}\to a$. The number $a$ is called the limit of the sequence $(x_{n})$. A sequence that does not converge to some real number is said to *diverge*
