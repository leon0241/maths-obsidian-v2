> Suppose $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence. A subsequence of this sequence is a sequence of the form $(x_{n_{k}})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ where for each $k$ there is a positive integer $n_{k}$ such that
> $$n_{1} < n_{2} < \cdots < n_{k} < n_{k+1} < \cdots$$
> Thus, $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is just a selection of some (possibly all) of the $x_{n}$'s taken in order
