#### CW1 Tasks 
- Functional and Non-Functional requirements present and their implication on your later implementation (parts in CW1, most in CW2)
	- So, what do you have to implement?
- The challenges you foresee in implementing this system and how you are going to mitigate them.
	- What if things donâ€™t work out as planned?
- A potential project plan which shows clearly where the critical path is and how you can mitigate should something go wrong / shift.
	- Make it clear what will happen when and how
- Use UML to conceptually solve / architect some 2 critical areas in the application.
	- You are free to choose any two areas you like; just explain why you chose
them.

Use between around 750 and max. 1,000 words to describe your thoughts.
