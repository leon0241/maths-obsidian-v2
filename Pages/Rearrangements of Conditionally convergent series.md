> Let $S = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}$ be any conditionally convergent series. Then there exists rearrangements $z:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ (where $z$ is a bijection) such that
> - For any $r\in\mathbb{R}$ the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ is conditionally convergent and its sum is $r$
> - The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ diverges to $+\infty$
> - The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ diverges to $-\infty$
> - The partial sums of the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{z(k)}$ oscillate between any two real numbers
