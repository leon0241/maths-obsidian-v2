> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Pages/Definition of curvature|Definition of curvature]]
> For a [[Pages/Norm of a Curve#^d8cb44|unit-speed curve]] $x(s)$ the curvature $\kappa(s)$ is defined by
> $$\kappa(s) = \lvert T'(s) \rvert (=\lvert x''(s) \rvert )$$
> For a general parameterisation this becomes $\kappa(t) = \lvert T'(t) \rvert/v(t)$ (chain rule)
